I completed this course in Q1 2020, with the aim to refresh my python skills in preparation for learning and applying ML/AI libraries such as scikit-learn, tensorflow/keras etc. See below a brief summary of what was covered along with links to my notes/code on each section.


## Course Contents

### Section 3 Python Basics

* Learning different class types and methods on those classes to structure our data appropriately as well as some basic functions.



### Section 4 Python Basics 2

* if statements and for loops as well as some new functions such as ennumerate
* Paremeters (name) and arguments (matt).
* Defining functions.
* Scope - what does the function have access to.



### Section 5 Developer Environment

* Terminal, code editors, IDE's and notebooks explained.



### Section 6 Object Oriented Programming

* Generating our own classes and methods on those classes.
* 4 pillars of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.
* Introspection and dunder methods.
* Super inheritance and method resolution order.



### Section 7 Functional Programming

* map, filter, zip and reduce (all higher order functions).
* Lambda expressions.
* Comprehension, list, set and dict.



### Section 8 Decorators

* Higher order functions.
* Passing in parameters and decorator syntax.
* Performance decorator   &   authenticate decorator.



### Section 9 Error (Exception) Handling 

* while true, try, except, else (break), finally - syntax.
* raise & exception statement.



### Section 10 Generators

* for i in range(n) .. yield.
* Allows the user to pass through a range one at a time without having a list in memory.



### Section 11 Modules in Python

* Installing packages from pypi with pip.
* Importing build in modules and installed modules as well as individual functions, including sys.



### Section 12 Debugging in Python

* pdb python debugger.



### Section 13 File I/O

* File input/output.
* with statement and r(+), w(+) or a(+) modes. Main difference is where the stream is positions and ability to truncate.



### Section 14 Regular Expressions

* These are used to test the contents of a string, useful for things like pasword or email validation.



### Section 15 Testing in Python

* Looked at unittest and how to use it to spot areas for improvement in your code. 



### Section 16 Career of a Python Developer

* Brief section on what career options are available.



### Section 17 Scripting with Python

* Image_processing -> using PIL and Pillow to filter, resize and convert images from JPG to PNG.
* PDF_Processing -> using PyPDF2 to combine, rotate and merge PDF's. Learned how to open a PDF by using intantiating it as a PdfFileReader or PdfFileWriter class.



### Section 18 Scraping Data with Python

* Using the beautiful soup api to scrape web data.
