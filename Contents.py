Section 3 Python Basics

* learning different class types and methods on those classes to structure our data appropriately as well as some basic functions.



Section 4 Python Basics 2

* if statements and for loops as well as some new functions such as ennumerate
* paremeters (name) and arguments (matt)
* defining functions 
* scope - what does the function have access to



Section 5 Developer Environment

* terminal, code editors, IDE's and notebooks explained



Section 6 Object Oriented Programming

* generating our own classes and methods on those classes
* 4 pillars of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism
* introspection and dunder methods
* super inheritance and method resolution order



Section 7 Functional Programming

* map, filter, zip and reduce (all higher order functions)
* lambda expressions 
* comprehension, list, set and dict



Section 8 Decorators

* higher order functions
* passing in parameters and decorator syntax
* performance decorator   &   authenticate decorator



Section 9 Error (Exception) Handling 

* while true, try, except, else (break), finally - syntax
* raise & exception statement



Section 10 Generators

* for i in range(n) .. yield.
* allows the user to pass through a range one at a time without having a list in memory



Section 11 Modules in Python

* installing packages from pypi with pip
* importing build in modules and installed modules as well as individual functions, including sys



Section 12 Debugging in Python

* pdb python debugger



Section 13 File I/O

* file input/output
* with statement and r(+), w(+) or a(+) modes. Main difference is where the stream is positions and ability to truncate.



Section 14 Regular Expressions

* these are used to test the contents of a string, useful for things like pasword or email validation.



Section 15 Testing in Python

* looked at unittest and how to use it to spot areas for improvement in your code. Not the best taught section I must be honest, maybe worth revisting later.



Section 16 Career of a Python Developer

* 
* 



Section 17 Scripting with Python

* Image_processing -> using PIL and Pillow to filter, resize and convert images from JPG to PNG.
* PDF_Processing -> using PyPDF2 to combine, rotate and merge PDF's. Learned how to open a PDF by using intantiating it as a PdfFileReader or PdfFileWriter class.



Section 18 Scraping Data with Python

Section 19 Web Development in Python

Section 20 Automation/Testing

Section 21 Machine Learning + Data Science
